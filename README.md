I want to fully develop my skills, understand programming languages, learn a structured approach to problem-solving, and learn how to work in a team. I also want to explore other areas, such as working with databases, analytics/processing, and in the future, Iâ€™d like to try myself in cybersecurity.
## My Computer Experience
I already have experience working with text editors, some Python, and more. I want to continue to develop my skills and gain new experiences.
